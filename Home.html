              >Jellyfish are over 600 million years old, older than dinosaurs.
            </b>
            They are the oldest multi-organ animal, surviving all five of
            Earth’s mass extinction events.
          </li>
          <li><b>Jellyfish don’t have brains and are 98% water.</b></li>
          <li>
            <b>Some jellyfish have teeth. </b>
            The beroid comb jellyfish has hundreds of rows of teeth. They are
            made of tiny hairs that can pierce, tear and pull their prey into
            their stomachs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Jellyfish can clone themselves. </b>
            If you cut a jellyfish in half, the pieces of the jellyfish can
            regenerate and turn into two new jellies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Jellyfish have been to space. </b>
            In 1991, moonfish jellyfish travelled into outer space on the Space
            Shuttle Columbia. Scientists wanted to examine how microgravity
            affected them. The jellyfish multiplied in space. When they came
            back to Earth, the scientists discovered that the space-born
            jellyfish couldn't figure out how to deal with gravity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some jellyfish (like the upside-down jellyfish, Cassiopeia
            xamachana) are vegetarians that grow their own food and carry it
            with them. These jellyfish raise algae inside their belly, giving
            them a food source that they take along as they float through the
            oceans.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Some Jellyfish Might Be Immortal. </b>
            At least one species of jellyfish, Turritopsis nutricula, may be
            able to cheat death. When threatened, this species is capable of
            undergoing cellular transdifferentiation, a process whereby the
            organism's cells essentially become new again.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Jellyfish can glow in the dark. </b>Approximately 50% of
            jellyfish are bioluminescent, meaning they can produce light. The
            vibrant, colorful hues these animals emit when they glow in the dark
            aren’t accidental—they use this light to defend against predators
            and attract prey. Comb jellies, for instance, produce bright flashes
            of light to startle their predators and give them time to escape.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Some jellyfish perform a “mating dance”. </b>One jellyfish
            species has been observed performing a mating ritual that involves a
            courtship dance. The male uses his tentacles to grab a female’s
            tentacles, pulling her closer to him. He then uses his tentacles to
            pass his sperm to one of the female’s tentacles before the pair
            splits off.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Dead jellyfish can still sting. </b>Be careful when touching or
            getting into contact with a dead jellyfish. Even if they are long
            dead, the venom on their tentacles is still prevalent and can cause
            harm. Their tentacles will continue to release poison until they are
            removed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Jellyfish kill more humans than sharks. </b>According to reports,
            jellies are more likely to kill people than sharks. They can cause
            40 deaths annually or larger than shark-related fatalities (about 13
            in the year 2020). This is because jellyfish are highly poisonous
            and difficult to avoid.
